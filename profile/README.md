Do you enjoy beer? What about process control, thermodynamics and kinetic modelling? Controlling this biological process to achieve the desired beer characteristics is challenging to this day. Large breweries have access to sophisticated devices for process control, but what about homebrewers and craft breweries who canâ€™t spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on high-end equipment? The Brewing Internet of Things (BIoT) aims to design and implement low-cost data monitoring and develop innovative techniques to brew novel, high-quality beers through various projects.
